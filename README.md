# üë©‚Äçüíª Muhammad Naja

My name is Muhammad Naja I'm a Software Engineer based in Egypt. I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform ‚ù§Ô∏è.

I enjoy creating and contributing to open-source projects outside of my job. In addition to learning a lot of new stuff, I'm able to grow as a developer by supporting other open-source projects. My blog also contains technical articles that I enjoy writing.

In order to better myself and others, I'm always striving to learn more and more.
